SBA 319: MongoDB Database Application

This assessment measures your understanding of MongoDB and your 
capability to implement its features in a practical manner. You 
have creative freedom in the topic, material, and purpose of the 
web application you will be developing, so have fun with it! 
However, remember to plan the scope of your project to the 
timeline you have been given.

This builds from my SBA 318 repo where my application tries to 
mimic that of an E-commerce website that has users be able to view, 
create, update, and/or delete listings and profiles. MongoDB holds 
user infomation, listings, and user reviews.
